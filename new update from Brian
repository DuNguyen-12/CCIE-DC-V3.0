1.NXOS
- Connection as we have known, no change
- vpc is there om both N5k but we need to add
  + ip arp sync and delay restore 150
  + need to configure vpc peer-link
  + vpc 100,200 need to allow vlan 101-104 and spanning tree type edge trunk
- OSPF 
  + Most are configure with process DATACENTER, we just need to adjust few intefaces on 1 or 2 devices
  + MTU 9192 need to add on needed interface on DC1 devices
  + Loopback0 on all DC1 devices have been configured properly
  + Need to add router ID on each device at DC1 same with L0
  + DC2-N9K has pre-configured loopback0 ip 10.9.1.2/32
  + DC2-N7K1 has pre-configured loopback ip 10.0.7.2/32 and loopbackx with 7.7.7.1/32

- PIM
  + same as SPOTO BUM RP 100.0.0.1 (DC1) and 200.0.0.1 (DC2)
  + DC1-N7K1 has interface loopback254 is pre-configured with ip 100.0.0.1/32, loopback254 on DC1-N7K2 is pre-configured 10.0.10.x/32
  + DC2-N7K1 int loopback200 pre-configured ip 200.0.0.1/32
- VXLAN
  + There is no bgp at all on all devices in both DC1 and DC2, need to configure everything for BGP.
  + Route-map has been pre-configured on N5Ks and BGWs, DC2-N7K
  + IPN has known configuration
  + Add features, vlans, evpn, nve1, vrf XANDAR,..as SPOTO
  + Issue: I got this part on DC2-N7K, i thought it makes all vni are down when "show nve vni". It said, Admin state is Up / Operation state is Down. I configured: bridge-domain, vni, matching vni with bridge-domain, int nve1, evpn,...

- DCNM:
  + Even uncheck "Fabric monitor mode", update the password, validate successfully, the device DC1-N7K1 still not appears.
  + Re-sync Fabric --> Save & Deploy will return an error.
- NTP, Jumbo frame, Syslog: same with SPOTO

2. UCS
- Connections are same
- Ask to configure Po100 and Po200 to carry all VLANs from nxos section 101-104
- Ask to create vlan 10-13 (same with SPOTO) and add to uplink e1/12 which is connect to N5K3/4 port 1/4 (dont remember exactly). This port on N5K has configuration

   ############################
==> VNIC-A/B should have vlan 10-13 as SPOTO /  vlan 101-104 should be added to Web-vNIC-Templates????
- VNIC/VHBA/POOLs are same as SPOTO, UUID has been pre-configured
- VSAN-A (50) and VSAN-B (60) on fc30 both FIs
- Add UUID LINK policy as SPOTO, no lacp policy mention.
- WEB-SRVR-TEMP is preconfigured and is updating template, WEB-SRVR1 is binded to server 1/2. Update vnic, vhba,wwnn are same with SPOTO
- Clone WEB-SRVR-TEMP to WESX-SRVR-TEMP and create SP ESX-SRVR01, this will be bind to server 1/1.
- Make boot from SAN for ESX-SRVR01, name vHBA-1 and vHBA-2
- On N5K3/4 there are vsan 50/60 pre-configured but wrong name, messy mem pwwn setup.
- vsan 50 and vsan 60 are pre-configured and interfaces are mapping and all up
- There are 2 flogi on the storage side which are 50:xx and 20:xx on both N5K, i choosed the one with 20:xx but didnt work, have no time to check it.
- On N5K3/4, asks to create DC_vsan_50 and DC_vsan_60 zone/zoneset
- Boot from SAN as SPOTO with vHBA-1 (end with :10) and vHBA-2 (end with :11)
- FC span as SPOTO
- Multi choice questions as SPOTO

ACI. 
no update/all same as SPOTO and works as expected.
