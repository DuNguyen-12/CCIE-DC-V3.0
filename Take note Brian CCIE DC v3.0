Lab environment.
- The Design will take 3 hours max and whenever you finish the last question, 
DOO time will count right after that even you dont agree yet with the term and click OK to start it. SO, BE CAREFULL.
- I suggest you finish the Design in 1,5hours or less then STOP at the SECOND last question (the last question is END section and will start the DOO immediately). 
1,5hours left on the Design, try to type all the commands for every devices of NXOS section 
from scratch (EVEN THE PRE-CONFIGURATION you can learn from the practice lab) then when you start NXOS, 
either lab1 or lab2, you just need to adjust some variables on the text files, 
that will save you tons of time. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
- Check reachability of all devices + GUI accessing before you start the DOO. 
PING is not enough. If you see you can ping but cant access the GUI, kindly ask proctor immediately.
- A bit slow, expecially with GUI (ACI,UCSM,..) some time i had to click the submit few times to get it done.
- Test PC need to zoom out to see everything clearly for GUI (ACI,UCSM,..), but then took time to navigate to the other device CLIs .
- The TEST PC is not the physical PC you are working on, its on the web browser with other devices CLIs.
Basically, you need open 3 browser windows. Should not open more than that, if you got kicked out of the citrix, you lost the text file.
   + 1 for devices
   + 1 for topology and general infor (vlan,SAN,topo,..)
   + 1 for tasks which will have 3 main sections (NXOS,UCS,ACI)
- I suggest before starting nxos configuration, start DCNM first to make sure you can see and can select the DC1-N7K to add the interface.
   + uncheck fabric monitoring mode
   + update password
   + validate
   + re-sync > save & deploy --> i couldnt do this since i dont know it will blow out my previous configuration so thats why i suggest to do in first place.   
- Over cli, you have to right click, copy then paste. This behavior will take time if you familiar with the old way (bold out = copy in SecureCRT or putty), 
practice this way. I got sever times to put the wrong commands, since i thought bold the text = copy :)).
- Script, i suggest you to learn the whole file which is gw-pythoninitial.py on DC2-N9K (practice lab), my case, 
they removed some parts. i skipped this since there is no time. Do not move when insert mode, it will create weird charactor.
Insert and type only, want to move? press ESC then move to the place you want then Insert mode. Practice this.
- Dont try more than 5-10mins on 1 issue, leave it then do later.
- SAVE configuration after every question.
- Lastly, the design must be stable, otherwise you will fail even DOO you got 100%.
